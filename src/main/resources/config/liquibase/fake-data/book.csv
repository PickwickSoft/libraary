First commissioned to match illustrations that had benn done, "The Pickwick Papers" took on a life of its own. Serialized in 20 monthly installments from March 1836 to November 1837, it took the public by storm, From 400 copies in the first installemnt it rose to 40,000 copies by the fifteenth.\nThe Pickwick club is a thinly veiled parody of the English Parliament complete with ludicrous speeches, pompous debates and insult presented as apologies. Not satisified with mocking Parliament, Dickens then took on the English Court system.\nMore the 150 characters appear in this novel but two stand out above the rest, Pickwick himself and cockney Sam Weller.;Pickwick Papers;;../blob/image.png
2;978-0957570085;234;2015;Soundcheck Books;"In Sail Away: Whitesnake's Fantastic Voyage - the first ever full biography of the band - top music writer Martin Popoff tells the tale of rock legend David Coverdale, from his Deep Purple roots to the two distinct incarnations of his mega-popular creation. Whitesnake began life as a UK-based blues rock outfit, until the lad from England's chilly east coast departed for America's sunny west coast in search of fame, fortune, big videos and even bigger hair. Coverdale found them all, and 1987's self-titled album went 8 x platinum in the US alone before their bright star waned in the face of grimy grunge. In this book - his 45th - Popoff interviewed the major players, including Coverdale himself, to piece together the band's roller-coaster history. He follows their story through the hirings and firings, the splits and reunions and the image changes to paint an affectionate yet realistic picture of one of the giants of rock. If you remember great tracks such as ""Here I Go Again,"" ""Fool For Your Loving,"" ""Still Of The Night,"" ""Slow An' Easy,"" ""Crying In The Rain,"" ""Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City,"" or ""Love Ain't No Stranger,"" then this book is essential reading. The Sail Away refers to how Coverdale re-invented himself by sailing away to America's West Coast and making himself right at home. He loves it, and America loves him.";Sail Away;Whitesnake's Fantastic Voyage;../blob/sail_away.png
